# Desing Patterns

## Starting.. ðŸš€

We'll download these tools to compile the proyect in our local machine:

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [OpenJDK 8](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) - Development Kit
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - Framework

This proyect is to implement somes desing patterns on Spring Boot Framework.

## Command pattern

Using different types of hero commands For example, add new hero or get all heros from the list. Implement ICommand by types of request and response objects we can access to the command easily. But the problem with these implementation is create one dependency for each command in the controller.
